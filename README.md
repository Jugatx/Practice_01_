 House price prediction modeling

Although the house price prediction project is a common one to find amongst Data Science starters, I have decided to add it to my github 
as it was my first Data Science project and I am fond of it!

The project was great for data cleaning, EDA, practicing different algorithms. 
Also, at the end, I did a pipeline just as my first test using pipelines.
